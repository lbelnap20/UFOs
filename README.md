# UFOs

## Overview 
Use Javascript to build an interactive table to hold data about UFO sightings, with the ability to search by five criteria.

## Results
To use the search function, fill in one or more seach boxes with desired parameters and hit the "enter" key on keyboard. To clear the serch form, click on the "refresh" button on the browser.

## Summary
There are a couple drawbacks to this design; first there is no reset button to clear the search boxes and rest the table, second there is no way to download the filtered results into a csv file for later use. In the original design the search text was case senstive, so I added script to make it insenstive.
